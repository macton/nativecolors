DIRECTORY STRUCTURE
-------------------
Loosely based on fhs http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html

/usr

/usr/src
- Source specific to this environment 

/usr/src/examples
- Very small examples to get you started creating new nativecolors or general native client projects

/usr/packages
- Read-only hosted external source packages.
- Do not change from original source. Any necessary patches should be applied in /usr/ports.

/usr/ports
- Build scripts and any additional patches required to build packages for the nativecolors environment
  or native client in general.
- Ports may provide either host or client libraries/nexes or both.

/usr/bin
- Pre-build binaries (nexe) which can be used on in the nativecolors environment on any host.

/usr/include
- Include files from ports and /src projects used to compile projects.

/usr/lib
- Pre-built libraries from from ports and /src projects used to build projects.

/usr/archive
- Random stuff saved for reference

/srv
- Files expected to be served from a server running on the environment hosting these files

/srv/www
- Files expected to be served from an http server. This directory is assumed to be the root of that
  server.
- Projects from /usr/ports and /usr/src may be pre-installed in this directory.
