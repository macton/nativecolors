Unreleased tip-of-trunk changes:

* Add 'enable-8-bit-control' preference to enable eight bit control sequences.
  This is off by default (which matches xterm) in order to avoid accidental
  usage of some sequences that require termination.  If you encounter one of
  these on accident (while cat'ing binary data, for example) the terminal
  will appear to lock up while waiting for the terminator byte.
* Add 'max-unterminated-sequence' preference to prevent sequences that require
  a terminator from running away forever.
* Squelch warning that used to appear when clearing an empty screen.
* Refactor the parser logic a bit to make it easier to back up when
  we fail to find the end of a string sequence.
* Fix to DECSTBM to resepect origin mode when resetting the cursor position
  after setting the VT scroll region.
* Make soft-reset more like xterm.
* Resize the terminal after the character measurements change rather than
  re-measure the character during a resize.  The latter causes the terminal
  to get the row, column count wrong based on event ordering.

Internal bug:
6375936 hterm hangs when \x90, \x9D, or \x9E is printed

BUG=chromium-os:30142

0.7.9.3, 2012-04-20, rginda@chromium.org

* Show app name and version number at startup.
* Add cursor blink preference.
* Add doc/faq.txt.

0.7.9.2, 2012-04-19, rginda@chromium.org

* More sanitary handling of color names in the palette set/get sequence.
* Added colors.js file to contain color utilities and palettes.
* Remove old vt100.js file.

0.7.9.1, 2012-04-18, rginda@chromium.org

* Allow Ctrl +/-/0 to control browser zoom when the browser zoom isn't already
  set to 100%.  This makes it possible to dismiss the new "zoom warning" using
  keyboard shortcuts.

0.7.9.0, 2012-04-18, rginda@chromium.org

* Modify nassh plugin to accept a hash of environment variables.
* Add 'environment' preference, set by default to { TERM: 'xterm-256color' }.
* Implement Operating System Command (OSC) 4.  This allows the host to set
  or read the terminal color palette.
* Reset color palette on soft terminal reset.
* Add JSDoc to text_attributes.js.
* Merge COLORS_16 and COLORS_256 objects into a single
  TextAttributes.prototype.defaultColorPalette object.
* Fix bold-implies-bright logic for extended colors.
* Add a stern warning message when the browser zoom is not 100%.
* Change the naming convention for sessionStorage keys (added a dot, as in
  googleRelay.queryString).
* Add logic to re-display the connect-to dialog on reload, only if nassh was not
  started from a bookmark.
* Fetch the HTML5 persistent filesystem at nassh startup.
* Add NaSSH..removeAllKnownHosts() and NaSSH..removeKnownHostByIndex(i).  These
  can be accessed from the JS console as 'term_.command.remove...()'.
* Fix Terminal.isPrimaryScreen() assign-instead-of-test typo.
* Fix G0/G2/G3 character set control "ESC (", etc. to properly handle a
  mid-sequence ESC character.  (Thanks to nethack for turning this up :)

0.7.8.3, 2012-04-11, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix 'home-keys-scroll' preference.

0.7.8.2, 2012-04-11, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix google_relay.html CSP issues.

0.7.8.1, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix update_url in manifest.

0.7.8.0, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Replace 'alt-sends-escape' preference with 'alt-sends-what'.  The new pref
  can be set to 'escape', '8-bit', or 'browser-key'.  If set to 'escape' (the
  default), hterm will send ESC (as if alt-sends-escape were true, the previous
  default).  If set to '8-bit', hterm sends the unshifted character + 128 (as
  if alt-sends-escape were false).  If set to 'browser-key', hterm waits for
  the keypress event, and sends whatever character code the browser thinks best.
  On Mac, this will depend on your keyboard locale.  Composed characters
  (requiring multiple keystrokes) aren't yet implemented.  'browser-key'
  shoudn't be used in cases where Chrome uses Alt sequences for the browser.

0.7.7.1, 2012-04-10, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix crosh.html/js to work with CSP.

BUG=chromium-os:29179
TEST=Install on ChromeOS, press Ctrl-Alt-T.

0.7.7.0, 2012-04-08, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix version number.  We should have gone to 0.7.7.0 rather than 0.7.6.4 :/
* Renamed to "Secure Shell".
* Updated stable manifest to include CSP and new icons.

BUG=chromium-os:29148

0.7.6.6, 2012-04-06, rginda@chromium.org

* Update to the latest nassh binaries.

0.7.6.5, 2012-04-06, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix Ctrl-\.
* Added keyboard related preferences, 'home-keys-scroll', 'page-keys-scroll',
  'meta-sends-escape', 'backspace-sends-backspace'.
* Added altSendsEscape option to keyboard (and 'alt-sends-escape' pref).  The
  default for alt-is-meta is now false, while alt-sends-escape is true.  This
  lets Alt and Meta be distinct keys when possible (like on a Mac), while making
  Alt work "almost" like meta by default.
* Added a little platform detection logic so we don't burn BOTH Alt-1..9 and
  Meta-1..9 on every platform.
* Fixed broken backspaceSendsBackspace behavior.
* Fix Meta-Space to send ESC \x20 rather than ESC [.
* Fix character sizing issues, which solves the missing underscores in some
  fonts, and should solve partial/completely missing terminal row issues.
* Add background-image pref, defaults to a mostly transparent gradient.
* Change a few one-byte colors to work better with both light and dark
  backgrounds.

Internal bugs:
6100845 Significant color differences with hterm compared to shellinabox
6183497 Backspace sends delete to emacs
6270109 option-space sends ESC [
6270158 hterm (OS X): option-v and option-1 thru option-9 have no effect
6063659 First line of the console appears off the top of the screen

0.7.6.4, 2012-04-04, rginda@chromium.org

* Add 'manifest_version': 2 to manifest file, specify default
  Content Security Policy (CSP) policy.
* Kick off nassh initialization from nassh.js rather than
  nassh.html to make CSP happy.
* Move dialog code from terminal.* into nassh.*, makes CSP happier
  and it's the right thing to do.

BUG=chromium-os:28561

0.7.6.3, 2012-03-19, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix regression that caused hterm to fail to load if the chosen font was not
  "safe" for bold charcters.

BUG=chromium-os:28020

0.7.6.2, 2012-03-16, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix regression in terminal reset.

BUG=chromium-os:27950

0.7.6.1, 2012-03-15, rginda@chromium.org

* Make the relay code more resiliant to intermittent failures.

0.7.6.0, 2012-03-14, rginda@chromium.org

* Refactor and clean up of the relay server code.
* Add backoff logic to relay server code.
* Promote Terminal.showOverlay to Terminal.IO.showOverlay.
* PASS on handling Meta-~, since on Mac Meta is Cmd and Cmd-~ is the 'switch
  between windows of this app' sequence.

0.7.5.2, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Re-add default tab width, add a testcase to catch future regressions.

0.7.5.1, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Cached scroll-on-output and scroll-on-keystroke preferences to avoid the
  performance hit of reading a preference for each bit of output and keystroke.

0.7.5.0, 2102-03-07, rginda@chromium.org

* Add preferences.  Preferences are persisted to localStorage.  Active hterm
  instances will respond to preference changes by listening to the 'storage'
  event.
* Preferences can be grouped into "profiles" so that it's possible
  to maintain multiple terminal configurations and easily switch
  between them.
* The preference profile can be selected at load-time by adding
  'profile=NAME' to the url used to load nassh.html or crosh.html.

0.7.4.4, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Add ability to detect fonts with mismatched bold/normal sizes, and disable
  bold characters when that happens.

0.7.4.3, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Switch out "Andale Mono" in favor of "Menlo" in the default font family list,
  since bold characters in Andale Mono are a different width than normal
  weight characters.

0.7.4.2, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix CONNECTING message to take a single DESTINATION parameter rather
  than distinct USER and HOST parameters.  This avoids an issue in the
  chrome i18n code that chokes on the translated messages.

0.7.4.1, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix remaining issues with ESC 0x20 handler.

0.7.4.0, 2012-02-28, rginda@chromium.org

* Fix permission issue in package.sh script.
* Remove spash screen.
* Fix syntax error in ESC 0x20 handler.
* Warn before closing an active crosh tab.

0.7.3.0, 2012-02-17, rginda@chromium.org

* Manifest files split into -dev and -stable versions.
* Add an altIsMeta flag, on by default.
* Treat Meta-C/Meta-Shift-V the same as Ctrl-C/Ctrl-Shift-V to
  make mac users happy.
* Pass (Ctrl|Meta)-Shift-B bookmark bar key to browser.
* Pass (Ctrl|Alt|Meta)-1/9 to the browser so as not to block
  tab switching.
* Skip pro-tip if nassh started with a known location.
* Fix TextAttributes.prototype.reset().
