NATIVE BLACK
------------

Native Black is a C API partially generated from the NaCl C PPAPI. The goals of the API are:

- Provide only a thin wrapper on the C API (no or minimal runtime cost)
- Simplify the API without changing it singificantly. 
  - e.g. Assume only a single instance per module.
  - The names and purpose of the API functions should be coresspond directly to the C PPAPI
- Add basic utility functions
  - All additional functions or structures outside of the C PPAPI should be marked "#nablack-utility"
  - The TWEAK macros give access to specific variables from the browser for development.
- Add basic conventions
